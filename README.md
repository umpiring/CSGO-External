# CSGO-External

Note: The code in this cheat was not the cleanest at all, everything in here can be done far more efficiently and cleanly.
That being said when I coded this I didn't plan on releasing it and rather kept it as a private source but it CSGO so I decided to share it.

Also credits to Cazz for some fo the help & Uhm in my discord for help as well :)

If you need help with anything join my discord and I'll help you out, please refrain from asking questions that are common knowledge and/or things 
that you are able to look up online.

Also the radar reveal may not work, I think I did it wrong lol.
